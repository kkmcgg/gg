# Catastrophic Forgetting

>> Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a neural network, after being trained on one set of information, loses its ability to perform tasks it learned earlier as it adapts to new data. In essence, the weight adjustments needed for new learning overwrite and disrupt the representations that supported previous knowledge.
