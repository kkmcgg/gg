# Graph cut optimization

>> family of combinatorial optimization techniques used to solve certain energy minimization problems by finding a minimum cut (or max-flow) in a specially constructed graph. This approach is widely applied in computer vision and related fields for tasks such as image segmentation, stereo correspondence, and texture synthesis, where the goal is often to find an optimal partitioning or labeling of pixels or data points.
