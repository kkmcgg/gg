Reusable prompt (copy/paste)

Write one paragraph (70–90 words) defining {TERM}. Give a plain-language definition, what it’s used for, and one or two pragmatic notes (typical inputs/outputs, scale, or a common pitfall). If the term has synonyms, include them inline. End the paragraph with “Refs:” followed by 2–4 short pointers (textbooks, guides, or well-known sites) that a reader could search for more detail. No bullets, no equations, no standards jargon. One paragraph only. Tone: precise, terse.

Examples

Watershed — The land area that drains rain and meltwater to a common outlet such as a stream mouth, lake, or culvert. Used to group terrain, flow, and water-quality behavior for modeling and management. Delineated from elevation data; culverts and road embankments often mislead automatic tools, so check pour points and breaks. Scale matters: large basins hide local problems. Refs: introductory hydrology texts; “watershed delineation” tutorials; USGS watershed basics; local environmental agency guides.

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) — A gridded surface giving ground elevation at regular cell spacing. Used for contours, slope/aspect, viewshed, hydrology, line-of-sight, and orthorectification. Resolution and vertical accuracy control what you can trust; artifacts from trees, buildings, or water flats are common—verify whether it is bare-earth or surface. Interpolation and resampling can smooth away sharp features. Refs: GIS textbooks on terrain analysis; “DEM vs DSM” primers; national mapping agency DEM FAQs.

Orthorectification — The process of removing terrain-induced distortion from imagery so every pixel maps to the correct ground location. Requires a sensor model and elevation data; better terrain and control points yield tighter alignment. Watch for shoreline shifts, building lean, and snow/ice causing mismatches. Always inspect residuals against known features before measuring distances. Refs: photogrammetry handbooks; remote-sensing course notes on orthorectification; vendor tutorials from ERDAS/ENVI/QGIS.
