# Delunay

>> Delaunay triangulation is a fundamental method in computational geometry and geographic information systems (GIS) for connecting a set of points into a mesh of non-overlapping triangles. The defining characteristic is that the circumcircle of any triangle in the network contains no other points from the input set in its interior, making it useful for creating surface models (TINs) and analyzing spatial relationships.
