digital image processing technique
used in image segmentation 
associated with morphological image processing 

also known as 'snakes'
segments using curves instead of pixels

start with a rough polygon and "shrink" onto the edge or segment iteratively 

iterations are parameterized by the "internal" and "external" energy of yhe curve. internal tries to make it smooth (morphology) and external tries to find the edge (intensity)
