# Datum

>> A reference system or surface against which horizontal positions (latitude/longitude) or vertical elevations (heights) are defined and measured on the Earth. Horizontal datums (e.g., NAD83) are based on a reference ellipsoid, while vertical datums (e.g., CGVD2013) are typically based on mean sea level or a geoid model.
